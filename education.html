        <p>My academic background spans from three years of pre-primary through primary, junior high, and senior high school, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical and problem-solving skills. I earned my Bachelor’s degree with a focus on core computing principles, laying the groundwork for my career in technology. Alongside my formal education, I obtained industry-relevant certifications to expand my technical proficiency. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in advanced algorithms, software development, and systems architecture. This progression reflects a continuous commitment to technical excellence and innovation.</p>

                <h7>University Education</h7>
                <p>As a graduate of the University of Energy and Natural Resources, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, with a strong foundation in embedded systems, IoT, and software development. My academic journey was marked by a hands-on approach to solving real-world problems through technology. As part of my final year, I undertook the Implementation of Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) on IoT Devices, a project focused on enabling remote firmware updates for edge devices—enhancing scalability, security, and maintenance efficiency in connected environments. I was also an active member of the Robotics Club, where I collaborated on projects that combined automation and intelligent control. My time at UENR equipped me with the technical depth and practical experience to drive innovation in embedded and connected systems.</p>

                <h7>Secondary Education</h7>
                <p>After completing my primary education, I joined St. John's School, where I was a proud member of House 2 (White House). My time at St. John’s was not only marked by academic dedication but also by active involvement in extracurricular and leadership roles. I served as the Organizer of the Legion of Mary, where I helped coordinate faith-based activities and fostered a sense of community and discipline among peers. This role strengthened my organizational skills, teamwork, and leadership qualities. The rigorous academic environment at St. John’s, coupled with its strong values-based education, played a significant role in shaping my character and preparing me for higher academic and professional pursuits.</p>
